/**
 * runtime.ts — the host half of a workflow run.
 *
 * Owns the worker lifecycle, the RPC bridge, the concurrency semaphore, the
 * per-run caps, and the progress log. The script's only route to an agent is a
 * `call` message landing here, which is what makes the caps and the abort story
 * enforceable at all: a script cannot go around them because it has nothing to
 * go around them *with*.
 *
 * Spawning is injected rather than imported. `AgentManager` is a large, stateful
 * dependency and wiring it in directly would make every test here an integration
 * test; a {@link WorkflowHost} stub is a dozen lines. The adapter that binds this
 * to the real manager lives at the call site.
